const url = 'http://localhost:8080/P1-najmendes/'//wasn't working ... until i realized this was the wrong url!!!

    //if you don't include a second param, it'll just send a GET request to the URL.

        //BTW we won't be using HTML forms anymore... it's too annoying to turn them into JSON
    });
